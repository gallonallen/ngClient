## ngClient 

ngClient is a demo application for reference when creating Angular applications that must consume web services.

It seems that most examples on the web follow the beginning http tutorial 
and load services directly into app.component or app.modules.  

The goal here is to follow the recommended modular structure and package modules, components, and services that can be reused across multiple applications.
